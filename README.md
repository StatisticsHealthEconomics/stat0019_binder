# STAT0019 Rstudio environment

This repository contains the set up to create a Rstudio environment with all the relevant packages and programmes installed.

This is useful to work on the practicals and the ICA. You may want to also install the full STAT0019 configuration on your local machine, but this is useful if you are in a hurry and want to do work.
