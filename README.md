# Summer School "Bayesian methods in health economics" 
## Rstudio environment

This repository contains the set up to create a Rstudio environment with all the relevant packages and programmes installed.

This is useful to work on the practicals. You may want to also install the full BMHE configuration on your local machine, but this is useful if you are in a hurry and want to do work (or you don't have full write access to your machine).
