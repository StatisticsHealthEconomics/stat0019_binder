docker run --rm -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v  ./practical:/home/rstudio/practical stat0019 bash

# run --rm: removes the container when it's closed
# -it: makes the session interactive
# -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY: makes the local display device (typically :0) available to the docker container
# -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix: adds the volume /tmp/.X11-unix from the local machine to the volume /tmp/.X11-unix in the docker
#                                   (this ensures that X applications such as graphs from R can be opened from the container)
# -v /home/gianluca:/home/rstudio/gianluca: adds the volume /home/gianluca from the local machine to the volume 
#                                           /home/rstudio/gianluca in the docker container, so that the local files can be used on the 
#                                           container and changed saved and made permanent
# r-4.2.1: name of the image to run in the container
